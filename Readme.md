Hi! I'm
# Ricardo Gonz√°lez

With the age of 13 years, i code web pages (mostly on php), but i also code on arduino and very rare times on javascript. I started coding on 2018, on Scratch and now, in 2021 i coded near 30 projects! I now work on VitezaCloud, as a manager.
Some of my most knowed projects are: VitezaCloud, SayHost, CatCatGo and Hackers Honey Pot.
I am actually re-starting to code, as i taked a "long vacation" this summer, so yeah)
