Hi! I'm
# Ricardo González

I’m a young Spanish web coder, taking my first steps into this world back in 2018. Starting on Scratch, I’ve later expanded to working with PHP, Arduino and Javascript. Up until now I’ve taken part in near 20 projects, some of them being SayHost, CatCatGo, Hackers Honey Pot and VitezaCloud, on wich I’m currently working as a manager
